        <h1 class="w3-center">How does technology affect our behavior?</h1><br>
        <p class="w3-large">Technology is making us more alone because instead of interacting with our friends in person, we are dependent on using our phones or tablets. We start to compare ourselves and our lives to others because of how many likes we get on our Instagram photos. We are forgetting how to use our basic communication skills because we aren't interacting with each other, anymore. We are too busy with our noses in our phones. Young kids are dependent on a tablet to keep them entertained rather than playing with toys. The more time we spend on our phones the less social we are. Social skills such as communicating are vital for one’s life. Communication is one of the many skills needed in almost all kinds of working environments. Humans send many nonverbal cues, from fidgeting to foot tapping, long pauses to eye contact. Reading those signs is a skill “that young people are not learning when they’re using these devices. In assessing social anxiety, analyses revealed a positive relationship between social anxiety. </p>
        <p class="w3-large">Results revealed females reported more social anxiety than males. In addition, females, more than males, reported feeling more comfortable using SITs (text messaging and online social sites only) rather than talking with others face-to-face. longitudinal data showed that as a person’s web browsing increased from 2004 to 2005, their loneliness also tended to increase (based on the global recall measure only). Both measures showed that increased non-email forms of web communication, including chat rooms, also went hand in hand with increased loneliness. Finally, more web browsing over time was linked with reduced life satisfaction by the time-diary measure, whilst more non-email web communication over time was linked with reduced life satisfaction by the global recall measure.</p>

        <h1 class="w3-center">How does social media allow for more online drama and cyberbullying?</h1><br>
        <p class="w3-large">“They don’t know how to handle conflict face to face because so many things happen through some sort of technology,” said Melissa Ortega, a child psychologist at New York’s Child Mind Institute. “Clinically, I’m seeing it in the office. The high school kids who I do see will be checking their phones constantly. They’ll use it as an avoidance strategy. They’ll see if they got a text message in the two minutes they were talking to me.”</p>
        <p class="w3-large">A dependence on devices can make it that much harder for children who are already struggling socially. Posting stuff on Snapchat and Facebook is not the same as effective as communicating to other people verbally and physically. In deed communicating with other people verbally has been shown to be effective rather than sending a quick message. When one is texting not much expressions have to be used, meanwhile when one is talking to others personally such as gestures and  body movement is required which helps; the speaker in conveying ideas and opinions throughout an audience.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-center">The Facts</h1><br>
      <h4>Usage</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">On average, 35–40% of teens reported using cell phones/text messaging and online social sites between 1 and 4 h daily, 24% reported using IMs 1–4 h daily and only 8% reported using email between 1 and 4 h daily.</p><br>
    
      <h4>Mental Health</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Over the last decade, anxiety has overtaken depression as the most common reason college students seek counseling services. In its annual survey of students, the American College Health Association found a significant increase — to 62 percent in 2016 from 50 percent in 2011 — of undergraduates reporting “overwhelming anxiety” in the previous year. Surveys that look at symptoms related to anxiety are also telling.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">In 1985, the Higher Education Research Institute at U.C.L.A. began asking incoming college freshmen if they “felt overwhelmed by all I had to do” during the previous year. In 1985, 18 percent said they did. By 2010, that number had increased to 29 percent. Last year, it surged to 41 percent.Those numbers — combined with a doubling of hospital admissions for suicidal teenagers over the last 10 years, with the highest rates occurring soon after they return to school each fall.</p><br>
    
      <h4>Online vs. In Person</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Human beings crave intimacy and we don’t get this if we are always face to face with technology rather than human ones. Neurobiologists have found we are wired for it. Yet genuine intimacy demands vulnerability and vulnerability requires courage. It requires that we lay down the masks we can so easily hide behind online, and reveal all of who we are with others. Some people who find this difficult, refer the computer or phone screen for that interaction rather than making themselves vulnerable to others.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">As a study by Harvard Business Review found, team performance went up 50% when teams socialized more and limited email for more operational only issues.</p><br>
    
      <h4>Does technology make teens more or less social?</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Recent studies have found that despite being more connected than ever, more people feel more alone than ever. Surprisingly, those who report feeling most alone, are those you’d expect it from least: young people under 35 who are the most prolific social networkers of all.48% of respondents only had one confidant compared to a similar study 25 years ago when people said they had about three people they could confide in. Because technology makes it easier to stay in touch while keeping distance, more and more people find themselves feeling distant and never touching. Or at least not enough to avoid us feeling increasingly alone.</p><br>
